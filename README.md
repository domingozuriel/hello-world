# hello-world
Lately, I have been thinking about tracking and sharing my work as a historian. I have considered creating a GitHub repository to provide a space for my current and future research projects.

This may represent a step toward the open-sourcing of historical knowledge. Readers are welcome to connect with me here; engaging with fellow scholars would be valuable.
